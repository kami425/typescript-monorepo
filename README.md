# Monorepo Project Template
This is a monorepo project template designed to help you quickly start a new project with a robust, scalable architecture. It provides a pre-configured environment with a consistent project structure and shared dependencies.

## Key Features
- Monorepo Architecture: Manages multiple packages within a single repository, ideal for large-scale applications with shared components.

- Next.js Application: A pre-configured Next.js app serving as the main entry point for your project.

- TypeScript Library: A separate, reusable TypeScript package that can be imported by the main app and other modules.

- pnpm Package Manager: Uses pnpm to efficiently manage dependencies, ensuring a single node_modules at the root to prevent version conflicts and reduce disk space.

## Getting Started
To use this template, simply clone the repository and start building! The project is structured to ensure a smooth and consistent development experience from the very beginning.
